                The Himachal Pradesh campus of Chitkara University is located in the village of Kallujhanda, near
                Barotiwala in the Solan district. This area is in proximity to Baddi, which is an industrial hub,
                providing students with nearby industry exposure and internship opportunities. The location offers a
                scenic, peaceful setting with pleasant weather, typical of the Himachal region, making it an attractive
                place for students to study and experience the Himalayan landscape.
